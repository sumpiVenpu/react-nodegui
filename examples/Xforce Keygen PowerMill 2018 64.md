Product keys are essential for activating AutoDesk products because they help to identify the specific product that a user has purchased or subscribed to. AutoDesk products can be sold as standalone applications or as part of a suite of applications that offer more functionality and features. For example, AutoCAD 2018 is a popular software for creating 2D and 3D designs. It can be bought and installed as a single product with the product key "001J1". However, it can also be included in the AutoCAD Design Suite Premium 2018, which is a collection of software that provides advanced tools for visualization, simulation, and presentation. In this case, the product key for installing AutoCAD 2018 is "765J1". This way, the product key distinguishes one package from another, even if they contain the same version of AutoCAD.

Product keys are usually provided in the confirmation email that a user receives after purchasing or subscribing to an AutoDesk product. They can also be found in the product packaging or on the product label. If a user loses or forgets their product key, they can contact AutoDesk customer support or use the online product key finder tool to retrieve it.
  
Product keys are only valid for the specific product and version that they are assigned to. They cannot be used to activate other products or versions. For example, a product key for AutoCAD 2018 cannot be used to activate AutoCAD 2019 or AutoCAD LT 2018. Similarly, a product key for AutoCAD Design Suite Premium 2018 cannot be used to activate AutoCAD Design Suite Standard 2018 or AutoCAD Design Suite Ultimate 2018.
  
Product keys are also linked to the user's account and license type. A user can only activate an AutoDesk product with the product key that matches their account and license type. For example, a user who has a single-user license for AutoCAD 2018 can only activate it with the product key that is associated with their single-user account. A user who has a multi-user license for AutoCAD 2018 can only activate it with the product key that is associated with their multi-user account.
