## How to optimize your title for SEO
  
Your title is one of the most important elements of your article. It is the first thing that search engines and readers see, and it can make or break your click-through rate. Therefore, you need to optimize your title for SEO by following these tips:

- Include 1-2 keywords related to your topic. Keywords are the words or phrases that people use to search for information online. By including them in your title, you signal to search engines and readers what your article is about and increase the chances of matching their queries.
- Place your keywords within the first 65 characters of your title. This is because most search engines truncate titles after 65 characters, so you want to make sure your keywords are visible and not cut off.
- Keep your title short and catchy. A long and boring title can deter readers from clicking on your article, while a short and catchy one can pique their interest and curiosity. Aim for a title that is between 6 and 12 words long.
- Consider moving a phrase from your title to the first or second sentence of your abstract. This can help you avoid keyword stuffing, which is when you use too many keywords in your title or content. Keyword stuffing can harm your SEO ranking and make your article look spammy. By moving a phrase from your title to your abstract, you can still include relevant keywords without overdoing it.

## How to optimize your headings for SEO
  
Headings are another important element of your article. They help you organize your content into sections and sub-sections, making it easier for readers and search engines to scan and understand your article. To optimize your headings for SEO, follow these tips:

- Incorporate keywords in your headings too. Keywords in your headings can help you rank for more specific and long-tail queries, which are more likely to convert into clicks and sales. For example, if your main keyword is "Nepali novels", you can use headings like "How to download Nepali novels for free", "Best Nepali novels of all time", or "Nepali novels by genre".
- Use heading tags correctly. Heading tags are HTML tags that indicate the hierarchy of your headings. The most important heading is the H1 tag, which should only be used once per page for your main title. The next level is the H2 tag, which should be used for your main sub-headings. The next levels are H3, H4, H5, and H6 tags, which should be used for further sub-headings. Using heading tags correctly can help search engines understand the structure and content of your article.
- Make your headings descriptive and informative. Your headings should give readers a clear idea of what each section of your article covers. Avoid vague or generic headings that don't tell readers anything about the content. For example, instead of using a heading like "Introduction", use something like "What are Nepali novels and why should you read them?"

By following these SEO writing tips, you can create articles that rank well on search engines and attract more readers to your website.
